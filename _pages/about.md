I am currently a software engineer at [Flyby Robotics](https://www.flybyrobotics.com/) where I develop the software infrastructure running on our drones and developer tools, including the [Flyby SDK](https://www.flybyrobotics.com/sdk). I also work on video streaming, sensor integration, cloud infrastructure, and user-facing applications. All the software running on our drone's GPU computer was written by me!

Check out some cool [drone applications](https://docs.flybydev.com/quickstart/capabilities)!

Previously I was at UCLA as a Computer Science Ph.D. student, which I left in 2024. While there, I studied quantum computing, and worked on optimization for quantum programs. I graduated from [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2018, and with an M.S. in Computer Science in 2020.

While at UIUC, I worked on the [K Framework](http://www.kframework.org) under Professor Grigore Rosu, where I implemented the I/O and FFI interfaces in the LLVM backend, implemented and tested pattern matching heuristics, and helped transition projects to the LLVM backend. I also worked with Professor Jose Meseguer on **IMPL** and its prover, found [here](http://mickyabir.com/research/).
