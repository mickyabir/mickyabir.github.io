I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [UCLA Compilers group](http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu) under Professor [Jens Palsberg](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/), where I am currently working on optimization for quantum programs. Previously, I graduated from [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2018, and with an M.S. in Computer Science in 2020.

While at UIUC, I worked on the [K Framework](http://www.kframework.org) under Professor Grigore Rosu, where I implemented the I/O and FFI interfaces in the LLVM backend, implemented and tested pattern matching heuristics, and helped transition projects to the LLVM backend. I also worked with Professor Jose Meseguer on **IMPL** and its prover, found [here](http://mickyabir.com/research/).

I also enjoy working on side projects, including arbitrage on smaller cryptocurrency exchanges and Python API wrappers for such exchanges ([txbit](https://github.com/AD-Ventures/txbit), [coinlist](https://github.com/AD-Ventures/coinlist), [coinex](https://github.com/AD-Ventures/coinex)). I also like to work on tiny projects, such as [tinybench](https://pypi.org/project/tinybench/).
